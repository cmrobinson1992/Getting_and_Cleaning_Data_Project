The Data:

The data used in this repository is found in the UCI HAR Dataset.  It includes 2 subsets, a test and a training dataset.  Each dataset contains 561 “features” which were obtained by calculating variables from time and frequency domains.  Also provided are the activity labels and the identifier of the subjects who carried out the experiment.

The Variables:

The following are the variables used in the tidy dataset:

Subject- an integer ID corresponding to the subject who carried out the experiment

Note: only variables that was the mean or standard deviation of a feature was included the tidy set.

Each feature was normalized and bound within [-1,1].

The variables were captured in 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The activity variable, originally provided as an integer from 1-6, was amended to be shown in its corresponding description, where:
 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
